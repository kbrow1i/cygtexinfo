The following packages have been updated in the Cygwin distribution:

* texinfo-6.1-2
* info-6.1-2
* texinfo-tex-6.1-2

Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to produce output in a number of formats, both online and printed (dvi, html, info, pdf, xml, etc.).

This is a rebuild of the 6.1-1 packages, patched to fix the bug reported in

Cygwin packaging
================

The info package contains the standalone info viewer as well as the install-info program.  The texinfo package contains everything else except support for the printable output formats (such as pdf).  The texinfo-tex package supplies the latter.  In particular, /usr/bin/makeinfo is in the texinfo package, but the command 'makeinfo --pdf' won't work unless you install texinfo-tex.
