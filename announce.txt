Subject: texinfo 6.4-1

The following packages have been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* texinfo-6.4-1
* texinfo-tex-6.4-1
* info-6.4-1

Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to
produce output in a number of formats, both online and printed (dvi,
html, info, pdf, xml, etc.).

This is an update to the latest upstream release.  See the release
announcement at

  http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-texinfo/2017-06/msg00023.html

for a list of changes since the last release.

Cygwin packaging
================
The info package contains the standalone info viewer as well as the
install-info program.  The texinfo package contains everything else
except support for the printable output formats (such as pdf).  The
texinfo-tex package supplies the latter.  In particular,
/usr/bin/makeinfo is in the texinfo package, but the command 'makeinfo
--pdf' won't work unless you install texinfo-tex.
