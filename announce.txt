Subject: texinfo 6.5-2

The following packages have been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* texinfo-6.5-2
* texinfo-tex-6.5-2
* info-6.5-2

Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to
produce output in a number of formats, both online and printed (dvi,
html, info, pdf, xml, etc.).

This is a rebuild of texinfo-6.5-1 for perl-5.26.1.

Cygwin packaging
================
The info package contains the standalone info viewer as well as the
install-info program.  The texinfo package contains everything else
except support for the printable output formats (such as pdf).  The
texinfo-tex package supplies the latter.  In particular,
/usr/bin/makeinfo is in the texinfo package, but the command 'makeinfo
--pdf' won't work unless you install texinfo-tex.
