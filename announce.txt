The following package has been updated in the Cygwin distribution:

* texinfo-5.2-3

And the following packages have been added:

* info-5.2-3
* texinfo-tex-5.2-3

Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to produce output in a number of formats, both online and printed (dvi, html, info, pdf, xml, etc.).

This is a re-packaging of texinfo-5.2-2, which is now split into the three packages listed above as suggested in

  https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-10/msg00568.html

The info package contains the standalone info viewer as well as the install-info program.  The texinfo package contains everything else from the old texinfo package except support for the printable output formats (such as pdf).  The texinfo-tex package supplies the latter.  In particular, /usr/bin/makeinfo is in the texinfo package, but the command 'makeinfo --pdf' won't work unless you install texinfo-tex.
